  abstract={We present a nation-wide network analysis of non-fatal opioid-involved overdose journeys in the United States. Leveraging a unique proprietary dataset of Emergency Medical Services incidents, we construct a journey-to-overdose geospatial network capturing nearly half a million opioid-involved overdose events spanning 2018-2023. We analyze the structure and sociological profile of the nodes, which are counties or their equivalents, characterize the distribution of overdose journey lengths, and investigate changes in the journey network between 2018 and 2023. Our findings include that authority and hub nodes identified by the HITS algorithm tend to be located in urban areas and involved in overdose journeys with particularly long geographical distances.},

  abstract={Carefully-designed prompts are key to inducing desired behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs). As a result, much human labor is dedicated to engineering prompts that tailor LLMs to specific use-cases, raising the question of whether this process can be automated. In this work, we propose an automatic prompt optimization framework, PROPANE, which requires no user intervention and solves the inverse problem of finding a prompt that induces semantically similar outputs to a fixed set of examples. We further demonstrate that PROPANE can be used to (a) improve existing prompts, and (b) discover semantically obfuscated prompts that transfer between models.},

  abstract={Effective deterrence requires confidence in robust naval replenishment capabilities, in order to maintain extended physical presence and support sustained military operations. While many authors have focused on vulcanizing penetration, projection, and defensive capacity, a compelling synergy arises from synthetic fuel generation, which may be conducted near point-of-need. In this work, we consider a modeling and simulation-driven approach to estimating the logistical and  operational impacts of marine and aviation fuel from alternative sources. Toward this end, we present the Fuel Replenishment and Logistics Simulation (FuelSim), a novel agent-based fuel paradigm assessment application designed to be lightweight, flexible, and integrable with large-scale systems analyses.},

  abstract={A critical factor for deterrence and any protracted conflict, is the ability to resupply our forces to maintain extended physical presence, which includes an ability to sustain naval air operations in remote areas. Successfully doing so must also minimize dependency on long-distance transport of fuel across oceans and be resilient to disruption of our fuel supply chain and operation of our fuel distribution facilities. This is a nontrivial logistics challenge as fuel replenishment logistics operate within a highly dynamic and interconnected system of combatants, auxiliaries, and fuel supply points, each with specific processes and behaviors that define how they interact with each other. Current logistics for replenishment of conventional aviation fuel have hard constraints that limit scale (e.g., limited fuel tanker resources) and subject to risk of potential cascading impacts due to disruption at strategic fuel supply points (e.g., calls for the Red Hill facility to halt operations due to groundwater contamination concerns). Toward these risks, ongoing research into alternative fuel sources for sustainable aviation fuel—following the motto, produce it when and where you need it—have increasing importance to national security. Advancing technology for scalable and mobile production of synthetic aviation fuel from alternative sources, such as seawater, promises to redefine naval replenishment logistics. While engineering challenges to make these technologies fully scalable are making progress, the operational feasibility of the adapted logistics must be fully understood. In this paper, we examine the system through a complexity lens and use agent-based simulation to develop an experiment platform to evaluate operational and environmental impacts over a range of scenarios. We propose this approach as useful for establishing relevant baselines, quantifying operational feasibility, providing guidance for the engineering teams, and ultimately characterizing the value proposition of synthetic aviation fuel for naval logistics. Finally, we discuss possible applications (e.g., wargaming).},

The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and several organizing partners held the second NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess competition in 2021. 18 bots competed in 9,180 games, revealing a dominant champion with 91% wins. The top four bots in the tournament matched or exceeded the performance of the inaugural tournament’s winner. However, none of the algorithms converge to an optimal, unexploitable strategy or appear to have addressed the core research challenges associated with Reconnaissance Blind Chess.},

  abstract={The identification and molecular profiling of early metastases remains a major challenge in cancer diagnostics and therapy. Most in vivo imaging methods fail to detect small cancerous lesions, a problem that is compounded by the distinct physical and biological barriers associated with different metastatic niches. Here, we show that intravenously injected rare-earth-doped albumin-encapsulated nanoparticles emitting short-wave infrared light (SWIR) can detect targeted metastatic lesions in vivo, allowing for the longitudinal tracking of multi-organ metastases. In a murine model of human breast cancer, the nanoprobes enabled whole-body SWIR detection of adrenal-gland microlesions and bone lesions that were undetectable via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as early as three and five weeks post-inoculation, respectively. Whole-body SWIR imaging of nanoprobes functionalized to differentially target distinct metastatic sites and administered to a biomimetic murine model of human breast cancer resolved multi-organ metastases that showed varied molecular profiles in the lungs, adrenal glands and bones. Real-time surveillance of lesions in multiple organs should facilitate pre- and post-therapy monitoring in preclinical settings.},
