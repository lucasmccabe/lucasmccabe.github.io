  abstract={A critical factor for deterrence and any protracted conflict, is the ability to resupply our forces to maintain extended physical presence, which includes an ability to sustain naval air operations in remote areas. Successfully doing so must also minimize dependency on long-distance transport of fuel across oceans and be resilient to disruption of our fuel supply chain and operation of our fuel distribution facilities. This is a nontrivial logistics challenge as fuel replenishment logistics operate within a highly dynamic and interconnected system of combatants, auxiliaries, and fuel supply points, each with specific processes and behaviors that define how they interact with each other. Current logistics for replenishment of conventional aviation fuel have hard constraints that limit scale (e.g., limited fuel tanker resources) and subject to risk of potential cascading impacts due to disruption at strategic fuel supply points (e.g., calls for the Red Hill facility to halt operations due to groundwater contamination concerns). Toward these risks, ongoing research into alternative fuel sources for sustainable aviation fuel—following the motto, produce it when and where you need it—have increasing importance to national security. Advancing technology for scalable and mobile production of synthetic aviation fuel from alternative sources, such as seawater, promises to redefine naval replenishment logistics. While engineering challenges to make these technologies fully scalable are making progress, the operational feasibility of the adapted logistics must be fully understood. In this paper, we examine the system through a complexity lens and use agent-based simulation to develop an experiment platform to evaluate operational and environmental impacts over a range of scenarios. We propose this approach as useful for establishing relevant baselines, quantifying operational feasibility, providing guidance for the engineering teams, and ultimately characterizing the value proposition of synthetic aviation fuel for naval logistics. Finally, we discuss possible applications (e.g., wargaming).},

  abstract={Reconnaissance Blind Chess is an imperfect-information variant of chess with significant private information that challenges state-of-the-art algorithms. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and several organizing partners held the second NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess competition in 2021. 18 bots competed in 9,180 games, revealing a dominant champion with 91% wins. The top four bots in the tournament matched or exceeded the performance of the inaugural tournament’s winner. However, none of the algorithms converge to an optimal, unexploitable strategy or appear to have addressed the core research challenges associated with Reconnaissance Blind Chess.},

  abstract={The identification and molecular profiling of early metastases remains a major challenge in cancer diagnostics and therapy. Most in vivo imaging methods fail to detect small cancerous lesions, a problem that is compounded by the distinct physical and biological barriers associated with different metastatic niches. Here, we show that intravenously injected rare-earth-doped albumin-encapsulated nanoparticles emitting short-wave infrared light (SWIR) can detect targeted metastatic lesions in vivo, allowing for the longitudinal tracking of multi-organ metastases. In a murine model of human breast cancer, the nanoprobes enabled whole-body SWIR detection of adrenal-gland microlesions and bone lesions that were undetectable via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as early as three and five weeks post-inoculation, respectively. Whole-body SWIR imaging of nanoprobes functionalized to differentially target distinct metastatic sites and administered to a biomimetic murine model of human breast cancer resolved multi-organ metastases that showed varied molecular profiles in the lungs, adrenal glands and bones. Real-time surveillance of lesions in multiple organs should facilitate pre- and post-therapy monitoring in preclinical settings.},
