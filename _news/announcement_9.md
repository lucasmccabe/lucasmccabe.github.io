It was a pleasure speaking with Brian Chidester on [Breaking the Huddle](https://governmenthuddle.podbean.com/e/breaking-the-huddle-exploring-data-science-ai-and-emerging-threats-in-government/). I wrote briefly about the episode [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lucashurleymccabe_breaking-the-huddlein-this-episode-activity-7289305728190676992-kVsf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABhJAXMBGDH7Lv83r7RQyrWOKuRsyAXO1bg).
