###### **Present:**

I am a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.lmi.org/">LMI</a>. There, I have served as machine learning lead for the <a href="https://www.lmi.org/capabilities/solutions/liger">LIGER</a> platform, modeled the climatic and operational impacts of synthetic jet fuel, developed software for maritime logistics, and more.

I am also a computer science PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu">GW</a>, advised by <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~howie/">Howie Huang</a>. My work primarily pertains to natural language processing and computational social science.
