  abstract={Reconnaissance Blind Chess is an imperfect-information variant of chess with significant private information that challenges state-of-the-art algorithms. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and several organizing partners held the second NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess competition in 2021. 18 bots competed in 9,180 games, revealing a dominant champion with 91% wins. The top four bots in the tournament matched or exceeded the performance of the inaugural tournamentâ€™s winner. However, none of the algorithms converge to an optimal, unexploitable strategy or appear to have addressed the core research challenges associated with Reconnaissance Blind Chess.},

  abstract={The identification and molecular profiling of early metastases remains a major challenge in cancer diagnostics and therapy. Most in vivo imaging methods fail to detect small cancerous lesions, a problem that is compounded by the distinct physical and biological barriers associated with different metastatic niches. Here, we show that intravenously injected rare-earth-doped albumin-encapsulated nanoparticles emitting short-wave infrared light (SWIR) can detect targeted metastatic lesions in vivo, allowing for the longitudinal tracking of multi-organ metastases. In a murine model of human breast cancer, the nanoprobes enabled whole-body SWIR detection of adrenal-gland microlesions and bone lesions that were undetectable via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as early as three and five weeks post-inoculation, respectively. Whole-body SWIR imaging of nanoprobes functionalized to differentially target distinct metastatic sites and administered to a biomimetic murine model of human breast cancer resolved multi-organ metastases that showed varied molecular profiles in the lungs, adrenal glands and bones. Real-time surveillance of lesions in multiple organs should facilitate pre- and post-therapy monitoring in preclinical settings.},
