###### **Present:**

I am Data Science Fellow and Principal Technical Advisor at <a href="https://www.lmi.org/">LMI</a>, where I serve as ML lead for the <a href="https://www.lmi.org/capabilities/solutions/liger">LIGER</a> application, among other things.

I am also a CS PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu">GW</a>, advised by <a href="https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~howie/">Howie Huang</a>. My research examines practical topics in machine learning and computational social science, with a recent focus on language models.

I am grateful to have been recognized as a <a href="https://forward.darpa.mil/risers">DARPA Riser</a>, Luminary Awardee (<a href="https://www.lmi.org/">LMI</a>), and Bernstein Scholar (<a href="https://iqb.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Institute for Quantitative Biomedicine</a>).


###### **Past:**

I wrote my master's thesis at <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/labs/tom-woolf-lab">Tom Woolf</a>. Before that, I studied math and computer science at <a href="https://www.math.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers</a> and developed computational tools for biological applications in the <a href="https://bme.rutgers.edu/prabhas-v-moghe">Moghe Lab</a>.
