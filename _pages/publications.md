I am an interdisciplinary data scientist interested in natural language processing (NLP) and computational social science (CSS). Recent work in NLP includes the discovery and analysis of “evil twin prompts” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07064">arXiv‘24</a>). In CSS, I led a large-scale network analysis of U.S. opioid-involved overdose journeys (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03924">arXiv‘24</a>). You can read more below or on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fXWneGkAAAAJ&hl">Google Scholar</a>.
