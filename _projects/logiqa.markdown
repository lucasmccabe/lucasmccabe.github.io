HuggingFace Dataset available [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lucasmccabe/logiqa).

#### Dataset Summary

*"LogiQA is constructed from the logical comprehension problems from publically available questions of the National Civil Servants Examination of China, which are designed to test the civil servant candidatesâ€™ critical thinking and problem solving. This dataset includes the English versions only; the Chinese versions are available via the homepage/original source."*

#### Dataset Structure

##### Data Instances

An example from train looks as follows:

```
{'context': 'Continuous exposure to indoor fluorescent lights is beneficial to the health of hamsters with heart disease. One group of hamsters exposed to continuous exposure to fluorescent lights has an average lifespan that is 2.5% longer than another one of the same species but living in a black wall.',
 'query': 'Which of the following questions was the initial motivation for conducting the above experiment?',
 'options': ['Can hospital light therapy be proved to promote patient recovery?',
  'Which one lives longer, the hamster living under the light or the hamster living in the dark?',
  'What kind of illness does the hamster have?',
  'Do some hamsters need a period of darkness?'],
 'correct_option': 0}
 ```

##### Data Fields

* *context*: a string feature.
* *query*: a string feature.
* *answers*: a list feature containing string features.
* *correct_option*: a string feature.
